Classic Cellular Automaton Implementation 
=====================================================================

Overview
--------
This repository contains a classic implementation of a cellular automaton, specifically 
Conwayâ€™s Game of Life. The simulation follows simple rules that model life, death, and 
reproduction on a 2D grid of cells.

Each cell is either alive or dead. At each generation (step), the entire grid updates 
simultaneously according to the standard rules defined by John Conway.



How to Build and Run
--------------------
1. Make sure you have a C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed.
2. If SDL2 is used, install SDL2 development libraries.
3. Build the project:
   make build
4. Run the simulation:
   make run

Applications
------------
- Demonstrates emergent behavior from simple rules
- Educational tool for cellular automata
- Basis for experimenting with artificial life, self-replicating systems, or complexity theory
